		<p>
		Hello, this is the elevator pitch for my application, Tour-Talk.
		</p>
		<p>
		Tour-Talk is an application created for tourists and people who wants to find restaurants, hotels or cultural events happening in a specific geographical area.<br>
		Very boring so far, isnâ€™t it? Keep listening.
		</p>
		<p>
		Who are the users?<br>
		My app users are going to be mainly tourists, looking for nice restaurants and hotels in the area, but also people living in the territory, who are looking for information about a cultural event they want to attend.
		</p>
		<p>
		What can the users do and how? <br>
		After landing in the Home Page and reading what the website is about, the user will have the chance of selecting one of the 3 main pages of the application: hotels, restaurants and cultural events.<br>
		On each of those 3 pages, users will see a map of the geographical area, with many interactive points that, when clicked, will redirect them to a chat room, where they can read and discuss in real time, asking questions to other users, about that specific restaurant they want to go, for example.
		</p>
		<p>
		What is the user experience going to be like?<br>
		Think about this app like the famous TripAdvisor, but based on live chat discussions instead of static reviews.
